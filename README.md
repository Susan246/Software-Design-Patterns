# Software Design Patterns

This repository contains code examples for various **Software Design Patterns**. These patterns are commonly used solutions to recurring problems in software development. The patterns help structure code in a more organized and reusable way, promoting maintainability and flexibility.

## Design Patterns Included:
The repository demonstrates implementations of the following design patterns:

### **Creational Patterns**
- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### **Structural Patterns**
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

### **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Iterator**
- **Mediator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template Method**
- **Visitor**

## Purpose of this Repository
The goal of this repository is to provide easy-to-understand code examples for the most commonly used design patterns. These examples are implemented in Python and aim to demonstrate the core concepts of each pattern.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Susan246/Software-Design-Patterns.git
