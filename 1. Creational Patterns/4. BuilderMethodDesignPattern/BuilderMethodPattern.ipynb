    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Complex Data Transformation:\n",
    "- Use Case: When transforming raw data into a complex structure (e.g., building a data model with multiple nested objects), the Builder pattern can be used to construct the object step by step.\n",
    "- Benefit: Simplifies the creation of complex objects by separating the construction logic from the object itself, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "2. ETL Pipeline Configuration:\n",
    "- Use Case: In an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, a Builder can be used to configure and construct the pipeline by adding various transformation steps, data sources, and loading mechanisms in a structured manner.\n",
    "- Benefit: Facilitates easy customization and extension of the pipeline, as new steps can be added without changing the core logic.\n",
    "3. Batch Processing Job Creation:\n",
    "- Use Case: When defining batch jobs for large-scale data processing (e.g., MapReduce or Spark jobs), the Builder pattern can be used to construct the job configuration (like input, output, and processing logic) step by step.\n",
    "- Benefit: Promotes flexibility by allowing easy modification and construction of different job configurations without having to rewrite the entire setup process."

    "### How the Builder Method Solves It:\n",
    "- Simplifies Object Creation: Breaks down construction into steps, avoiding overloaded constructors.\n",
    "- Centralized Control: The Director orchestrates construction, ensuring the correct sequence.\n",
    "- Scalability: New features can be added by updating the builder, without affecting client code.\n",
    "- Predefined Configurations: Builders can create predefined objects (e.g., luxury houses) easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components:\n",
    "1. Product: House represents the object being built.\n",
    "2. Abstract Builder: HouseBuilder defines steps like set_bedrooms, add_garage.\n",
    "3. Concrete Builders:\n",
    "- BasicHouseBuilder: Allows custom feature selection.\n",
    "- LuxuryHouseBuilder: Predefined house setup.\n",
    "5. Director: Manages construction process and applies the builder steps.\n",
    "6. Clients: Use builders via the Director to create customized or predefined houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- Builder avoids constructor overload, simplifies object creation, and allows flexible and scalable designs while keeping client code clean."
