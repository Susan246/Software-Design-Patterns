    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Multi-Database Data Pipeline:\n",
    "- Use Case: In a data engineering environment, where data needs to be processed from multiple types of databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL), the Abstract Factory can create different sets of database connection objects and query builders for each database type.\n",
    "- Benefit: Ensures consistency across different database types while allowing the easy addition of new databases without modifying existing code.\n",
    "2. Cross-Platform Data Integration:\n",
    "- Use Case: When integrating data from various platforms (e.g., cloud services, on-premise systems), the Abstract Factory can be used to create compatible data connectors and parsers for each platform.\n",
    "- Benefit: Facilitates the creation of consistent and compatible objects across different platforms, promoting flexibility and scalability in data integration tasks.\n",
    "3. Data Format Transformation:\n",
    "- Use Case: When processing data in different formats (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV), the Abstract Factory can provide a family of parsers and formatters, ensuring that data can be transformed consistently between formats.\n",
    "- Benefit: Allows seamless extension of supported formats without changing existing code, ensuring scalability as new formats are introduced."
