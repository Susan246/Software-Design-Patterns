    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Data Warehouse Integration:\n",
    "- Use Case: Simplifying the interaction between various ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) systems and the data warehouse.\n",
    "- Benefit: The facade can provide a unified interface to multiple ETL processes, making it easier to load data into the warehouse without needing to understand the intricacies of each ETL tool.\n",
    "2. Big Data Processing Pipeline\n",
    "- Use Case: Simplifying access to Hadoop, Spark, and other big data processing systems.\n",
    "- Benefit: A facade can provide a higher-level API to trigger complex big data processing tasks, abstracting the complexities of distributed computing and storage systems.\n",
    "3. Data Aggregation from Multiple Sources\n",
    "- Use Case: Aggregating data from multiple sources such as APIs, databases, and CSV files.\n",
    "- Benefit: The facade can provide a simple method for users to aggregate and process data from diverse sources, hiding the complexities of interacting with each data source."

    "- Shipping Management: Manages order delivery to the customer.\n",

    "- Complexity: The client needs to understand and manage the detailed interactions between subsystems.\n",
