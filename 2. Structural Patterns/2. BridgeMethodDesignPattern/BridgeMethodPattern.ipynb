    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Database Access Layer:\n",
    "- Use Case: When building an application that needs to support multiple database types (e.g., SQL, NoSQL), the Bridge pattern allows the core application logic to remain independent of the specific database implementation.\n",
    "- Benefit: It facilitates swapping out or adding new databases (e.g., switching from MySQL to MongoDB) without changing the data access logic.\n",
    "2. Data Storage Abstraction:\n",
    "- Use Case: In systems where data is stored in different formats (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV), the Bridge pattern can be used to separate the storage format handling from the core data manipulation logic.\n",
    "- Benefit: This allows the same core logic to interact with various storage formats seamlessly, and new formats can be added without modifying the existing codebase.\n",
    "3. Data Transformation:\n",
    "- Use Case: When data needs to be transformed between different structures (e.g., relational to JSON, or data normalization), the Bridge pattern helps separate the data abstraction (the general transformation logic) from the specific transformation strategy (how each format is transformed).\n",
    "- Benefit: It allows for easy extension of transformation types while maintaining a clean and flexible design."

    "## Scenario: \n",
    "- A system with multiple devices (e.g., TV, Radio, Speaker) requires different types of remotes (basic and advanced) to control these devices. Each device has basic functionality like turning on or off, but some remotes offer advanced features like muting."

    "### Problems Without the Bridge Pattern:\n",
    "- Tight Coupling: Abstractions and implementations are tightly coupled, making it hard to modify or extend either independently.\n",
    "- Code Duplication: New functionality often leads to duplication of code across different classes, especially when adding new features or components.\n",
    "- Inflexibility: Modifications or additions require changes across multiple places, leading to less maintainable and harder-to-manage code.\n",
    "- Difficulty in Extending: Adding new functionalities or components requires modifying existing classes, increasing the risk of breaking existing functionality."
