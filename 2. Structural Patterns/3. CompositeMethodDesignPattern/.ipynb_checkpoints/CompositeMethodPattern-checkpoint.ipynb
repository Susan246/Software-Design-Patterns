    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Data Transformation Pipelines:\n",
    "- Use Case: In ETL pipelines, different transformations (e.g., filtering, aggregation, mapping) are often applied to the data. The Composite pattern allows for treating both simple and complex transformations uniformly. Simple transformations like column filtering can be treated as leaves, while complex operations like aggregating and joining multiple datasets can be treated as composites.\n",
    "- Benefit: It simplifies managing complex workflows by treating them in a unified manner, where both simple and composite operations can be added or modified independently.\n",
    "2. Hierarchical Data Processing:\n",
    "- Use Case: When processing hierarchical data structures such as JSON or XML, composite operations can be used to navigate, filter, and aggregate data at different levels. For example, filtering records at the top level while aggregating nested data at lower levels.\n",
    "- Benefit: It enables easier manipulation of nested or hierarchical datasets, as each level can be handled with a combination of leaf and composite operations, making the code more flexible and easier to extend.\n",
    "3. Batch Data Processing:\n",
    "- Use Case: In batch processing systems, where large datasets are processed in chunks, composite operations can be used to execute a series of transformations sequentially. These operations could include reading, filtering, aggregating, and writing data, all managed through a common interface.\n",
    "- Benefit: It allows for managing different data processing tasks in a flexible, modular way, improving code reuse and scalability for complex data transformations."
