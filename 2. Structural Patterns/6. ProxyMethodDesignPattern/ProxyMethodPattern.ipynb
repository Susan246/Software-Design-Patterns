    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Lazy Loading of Large Datasets:\n",
    "- Use Case: Loading massive datasets only when required, such as large machine learning models or data from remote storage.\n",
    "- Benefit: The proxy delays the loading of the data until it is actually needed, reducing the initial load time and optimizing memory usage.\n",
    "2. Access Control for Sensitive Data\n",
    "- Use Case: Controlling access to private data stored in secure databases or cloud storage, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can retrieve it.\n",
    "- Benefit: The proxy validates the access request before allowing data retrieval, ensuring secure access without directly exposing sensitive resources.\n",
    "3. Caching Data for Performance\n",
    "- Use Case: Caching frequently accessed data, like real-time sensor data or stock market feeds, to speed up access and reduce the load on the data source.\n",
    "- Benefit: The proxy can check if the data is already in the cache and serve it immediately, reducing the need to query the database or external API, thereby improving performance."

    "### 1. Virtual Proxy Pattern\n",
    "- Problem:\n",
    "When an object is expensive to create or load (e.g., large data, images, or complex computations), it may not be efficient to instantiate it immediately when the client requests it. This can lead to unnecessary resource consumption, slow application performance, and delays in processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How Virtual Proxy Solves It:\n",
    "The Virtual Proxy pattern creates a proxy object that stands in place of the real object. The real object is only created when it is actually needed, a technique called lazy initialization. This reduces resource usage and speeds up the application's startup time by deferring the creation of resource-heavy objects until the client requires them.\n",

    "### Advantage of using Virtual Proxy Patter:\n",
    "- Improved Performance: Delays object creation until needed, reducing initial load time.\n",
    "- Reduced Memory Usage: Avoids upfront allocation of resources for unused objects.\n",
    "- Efficient Resource Management: Saves CPU and memory until the object is actually required.\n",
