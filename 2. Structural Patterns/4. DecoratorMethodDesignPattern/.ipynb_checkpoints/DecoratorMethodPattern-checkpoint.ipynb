    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Enhancing Data Processing Pipelines:\n",
    "- Use Case: In data engineering, processing pipelines often need to be enhanced with additional features like logging, validation, or transformation. The Decorator pattern allows wrapping existing pipeline components (like data processors or extractors) with extra functionality without modifying the original code.\n",
    "- Benefit: It provides flexibility in extending or modifying behavior dynamically, allowing new features to be added to the pipeline without altering existing components.\n",
    "2. Data Validation and Transformation:\n",
    "- Use Case: A system that processes raw data might need additional validation or transformation steps (e.g., ensuring data integrity, normalizing data formats). The Decorator pattern can be used to wrap data handling functions or classes with validation or transformation logic, making the system more modular.\n",
    "- Benefit: It promotes reusability and flexibility by allowing validation or transformation logic to be added or removed at runtime, making the system adaptable to various data quality requirements.\n",
    "3. Caching Results for Performance Optimization:\n",
    "- Use Case: In data engineering, performance is crucial, especially when working with large datasets. The Decorator pattern can be used to add caching functionality to data processing functions or classes, where the decorator checks if the data has been processed before and returns the cached result to avoid redundant computation.\n",
    "- Benefit: It helps optimize performance and resource usage by enabling caching mechanisms without changing the underlying logic of the data processing components."

    "## Scenario:\n",
    "- Imagine a coffee shop where customers can customize their drinks. The base product is a regular coffee, and customers can choose from a variety of add-ons, such as milk, sugar, or whipped cream, to customize their drink. Each add-on increases the cost of the coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Base Coffee class represents the basic product (coffee).\n",
    "CoffeeWithMilk, CoffeeWithSugar, CoffeeWithMilkAndSugar, and CoffeeWithWhippedCream are decorators that modify the behavior of the original Coffee object by adding more functionality (increasing the cost)."

    "### Problem Without the Decorator Pattern:\n",
    "- Class Explosion: New behaviors require creating a new subclass each time, leading to many classes to manage.\n",
    "- Inflexibility: Features are fixed in advance; adding or removing them dynamically at runtime is difficult.\n",
    "- Difficult to Extend: Adding new functionality requires modifying or creating new classes, violating the Open/Closed Principle."
