    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Data Processing Pipeline with Multiple Stages:\n",
    "- Use Case: In a data pipeline, different stages of data processing may require different operations depending on the data's state (e.g., raw, cleaned, processed). The State pattern can manage transitions between different processing states such as \"raw,\" \"cleaned,\" or \"transformed.\"\n",
    "- Benefit: The State pattern allows the pipeline to transition seamlessly between stages, applying appropriate logic at each state, and ensuring a consistent workflow for data transformation without complex conditional logic.\n",
    "2. Real-Time Data Monitoring Systems:\n",
    "- Use Case: In real-time systems that monitor data streams, the system can transition between states such as \"active,\" \"paused,\" or \"error\" based on data availability or processing status. The State pattern helps manage these transitions effectively.\n",
    "- Benefit: The State pattern enables the monitoring system to handle different states dynamically, providing appropriate responses based on the system’s current status, and ensuring better control over real-time data processing.\n",
    "3. Data Validation Workflow:\n",
    "- Use Case: In systems that validate data from multiple sources, different validation rules may be applied based on the state of the data (e.g., \"pending validation,\" \"valid,\" \"invalid\"). The State pattern can define and change validation behaviors based on these states.\n",
    "- Benefit: The State pattern provides a clean way to handle different validation states, allowing easy maintenance and scalability for validating complex datasets, ensuring that rules are applied correctly at each stage of the validation process."

    "The behavior changes dynamically by selecting different strategies (or algorithms). There is no repetitive internal state, and the change is based on switching strategies rather than transitioning states.\n",
    "- Example: A payment system dynamically selects a strategy like \"CreditCardStrategy\" or \"CashStrategy\" based on the user’s choice. There are no repeated internal transitions, just swapping strategies."
