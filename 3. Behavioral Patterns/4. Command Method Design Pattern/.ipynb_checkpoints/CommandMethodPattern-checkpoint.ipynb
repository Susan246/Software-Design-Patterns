    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Batch Data Processing Jobs:\n",
    "- Use Case: In batch processing systems, where large amounts of data are processed in scheduled jobs, the Command pattern can be used to encapsulate each batch job (e.g., data transformation, loading, or aggregation) as a command. This allows for flexible job scheduling and execution.\n",
    "- Benefit: The Command pattern enables modularity by separating the logic of the jobs from the scheduling mechanism, allowing for easy extension and reusability of individual data processing tasks.\n",
    "2. Data Export and Import Automation:\n",
    "- Use Case: When data needs to be exported from or imported into different systems (databases, APIs, file systems), the Command pattern can encapsulate each export/import action as a command. This allows users to queue, execute, and undo these actions easily.\n",
    "- Benefit: The Command pattern provides a structured way to manage various data export/import operations, enabling easy tracking, undoing, and automating complex workflows.\n",
    "3. Data Transformation Workflow Control:\n",
    "- Use Case: In data engineering, when multiple transformations need to be applied to a dataset in a specific order (e.g., cleaning, filtering, enrichment), the Command pattern can be used to encapsulate each transformation step as a command.\n",
    "- Benefit: The Command pattern allows for better control and flexibility over the sequence of transformations, enabling easy addition, removal, or reordering of data transformation steps without altering the core logic."
