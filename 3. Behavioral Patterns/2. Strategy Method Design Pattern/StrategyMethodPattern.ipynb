    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Dynamic Data Transformation:\n",
    "- Use Case: In data engineering pipelines, where different types of data transformation (e.g., aggregation, filtering, normalization) need to be applied based on the context or user inputs, the Strategy pattern can enable dynamic selection of the transformation logic.\n",
    "- Benefit: The Strategy pattern allows the system to easily swap transformation strategies at runtime, providing flexibility and efficiency in handling different data processing requirements without modifying the core logic.\n",
    "2. Choosing Data Storage Options:\n",
    "- Use Case: When processing and storing data, the Strategy pattern can be used to select the appropriate storage solution (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL stores, file-based storage) based on the type of data, size, and access frequency.\n",
    "- Benefit: The Strategy pattern enables a system to dynamically choose the best storage option at runtime, optimizing performance and resource utilization based on varying conditions.\n",
    "3. Optimizing Data Querying Approaches:\n",
    "- Use Case: For complex systems that query data from different sources (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, or graph databases), the Strategy pattern can help in choosing the best querying strategy based on the data structure and query complexity.\n",
    "- Benefit: The Strategy pattern allows the system to dynamically select the most appropriate query method depending on the data store being used, ensuring efficient and optimized data retrieval across different systems."
