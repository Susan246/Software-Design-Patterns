    "## Some Use Cases:\n",
    "1. Data Validation Pipeline:\n",
    "- Use Case: In data engineering, data often needs to pass through a series of validation checks (e.g., format validation, completeness, consistency). The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to process data through multiple validation steps, where each step decides if the data passes or needs further checks.\n",
    "- Benefit: This pattern allows the validation logic to be modular, easy to extend, and flexible. Each validation step can be added or modified independently without changing the entire validation pipeline.\n",
    "2. Error Handling in Data Processing:\n",
    "- Use Case: In complex data processing pipelines, errors or exceptions may need to be handled in different ways based on the type of error (e.g., data format error, missing value, network timeout). The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows for the delegation of error handling to different handlers based on the error type.\n",
    "- Benefit: The pattern enables flexible error handling by allowing multiple handlers to process an error in a chain, ensuring that the most appropriate handler is chosen dynamically.\n",
    "3. Log Processing:\n",
    "- Use Case: When processing logs from multiple data sources (e.g., system logs, application logs, sensor data), different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) or types of logs may need to be processed differently. The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to pass logs through a series of processors based on their severity or type.\n",
    "- Benefit: This approach ensures that logs are handled and processed in an organized manner, allowing for easy extension of log processors (e.g., filtering, aggregation, or alerting) without changing the core log processing logic."

    "## 1. Scenario: Logging System\n",
    "- In a logging system, we need to handle different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and process them in a sequence. The system should allow for different levels of logging to be handled differently based on priority. For example, ERROR logs should be immediately handled, while INFO or DEBUG logs may be stored for later analysis.\n",
